# UBlogApplication
A blogging website is a simple web application, which is created with the basic idea to allow users to post blogs or search for existing blogs. Medium.com and Wordpress.com are some of the examples of blogging websites.  As part of this project, you will create UBlog application, a miniature version of a blogging website.
